## Overview

hydrapp is a Go framework similar to Electron with unique feature: It **can use (almost) any browser engine** to render the frontend!

It enables you too ...

- **Build apps in Go and JS:** Use the speedy and easy-to-learn Go language to create your app's backend, then use your web tech know-how to develop a top-notch, user-friendly frontend.
- **Connect frontend and backend with ease:** With hydrapp and [dudirekta](https://github.com/pojntfx/dudirekta), you can easily call functions between the frontend and backend without any complicated manual setup.
- **Compatible with all browsers:** Hydrapp works with any pre-installed browser by starting it in PWA mode, so you can render your app on Chrome, Firefox/Gecko, Epiphany/Webkit, and even Android WebView.
- **Cross-compile with CGo easily:** Hydrapp simplifies cross-compiling with a container-based environment that includes MacPorts, MSYS2, APT, and DNF, making it easy to distribute binaries without using non-Linux machines.
- **Effortlessly build, sign, distribute, and update your app:** Hydrapp streamlines your app's delivery with an integrated CI/CD workflow, producing reproducible packages for DEB, RPM, Flatpak, MSI, EXE, DMG, APK, and static binaries for all other platforms. Hydrapp can also generate APT, YUM, and Flatpak repositories for Linux and F-Droid repositories for Android. Self-updating for Windows, macOS, and other platforms is also available.
