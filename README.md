## Overview

hydrapp is a small Go framework similar to Electron with unique feature: It **can use (almost) any browser engine** to render the frontend!

It enables you too ...

- **Build apps in Go and JS:** Use the speedy and easy-to-learn Go language to create your app's backend, then use your web tech know-how to develop a top-notch, user-friendly frontend.
- **Connect frontend and backend with ease:** With hydrapp and [panrpc](https://github.com/pojntfx/panrpc), you can easily call functions between the frontend and backend without any complicated manual setup.
- **Compatible with all browsers:** Hydrapp works with any pre-installed browser by starting it in PWA mode, so you can render your app on Chrome, Firefox/Gecko, Epiphany/Webkit, and even Android WebView.
- **Cross-compile easily with full CGo support:** Hydrapp simplifies cross-compilation with a container-based environment that includes MacPorts, MSYS2 on WINE, APT, and DNF, making it easy to distribute binaries without using non-Linux machines.
- **Effortlessly build, sign, distribute, and update your app:** Hydrapp streamlines your app's delivery with an integrated CI/CD workflow, producing reproducible packages for DEB, RPM, Flatpak, MSI, EXE, DMG, APK, and static binaries for all other platforms. Hydrapp can also generate APT, YUM, and Flatpak repositories for Linux and F-Droid repositories for Android. Self-updating for Windows, macOS, and other platforms is also available.

## Installation

hydrapp comes with a CLI to help with building and generating projects. While not required, it makes getting started a lot easier.

Its static binaries are available on [GitHub releases](https://github.com/pojntfx/hydrapp/releases).

On Linux, you can install them like so:

```shell
$ curl -L -o /tmp/hydrapp "https://github.com/pojntfx/hydrapp/releases/latest/download/hydrapp.linux-$(uname -m)"
$ sudo install /tmp/hydrapp /usr/local/bin
```

On macOS, you can use the following:

```shell
$ curl -L -o /tmp/hydrapp "https://github.com/pojntfx/hydrapp/releases/latest/download/hydrapp.darwin-$(uname -m)"
$ sudo install /tmp/hydrapp /usr/local/bin
```

On Windows, the following should work (using PowerShell as administrator):

```shell
PS> Invoke-WebRequest https://github.com/pojntfx/hydrapp/releases/latest/download/hydrapp.windows-x86_64.exe -OutFile \Windows\System32\hydrapp.exe
```

You can find binaries for more operating systems and architectures on [GitHub releases](https://github.com/pojntfx/hydrapp/releases).

## Tutorial

### 1. Creating a New Project

First, generate a new project by running `hydrapp new`, which will ask you some questions interactively. First, let's select the project type we want to start from; see [examples](#examples) for more information on the individual project types - for this example we'll use the `react-panrpc` template, which is the most full-featured one:

```shell
$ hydrapp new
? Which project type do you want to generate?:
    vanillajs-rest: Simple starter project with a REST API to connect the Vanilla JS frontend and backend
    vanillajs-forms: Traditional starter project with Web 1.0-style forms to connect the Vanilla JS frontend and backend
  â–¸ react-panrpc: Complete starter project with panrpc RPCs to connect the React frontend and backend
```

Next, let's select the app ID in reverse domain notation; for this example we'll assume that the project will be hosted on GitHub:

```shell
âœ” App ID in reverse domain notation: com.github.myusername.myapp
```

The app name, summary, description, homepage and Git repository follow the same schema:

```shell
App name: My App
âœ” App summary: My first app
âœ” App description: My first application, built with hydrapp.
âœ” App description: My first application, built with hydrapp.
App homepage: https://github.com/myusername/myapp
âœ” App git repo: https://github.com/myusername/myapp.git
```

Next up we'll set the base URL, which is the URL that the generated builds will be hosted on; for this example we'll assume that they will be hosted on GitHub pages:

```shell
âœ” App base URL to expect the built assets to be published to: https://myusername.github.io/myapp/
```

For the Go module name, we'll use the GitHub repo:

```shell
âœ” Go module name: github.com/myusername/myapp
```

Now we can set a license by choosing a SPDX identifier; note that this **has** to be a valid [SPDX identifier](https://spdx.org/licenses/) as it downloads the license text:

```shell
License SPDX identifier (see https://spdx.org/licenses/): Apache-2.0
```

Next up we enter the author name and email for release information:

```shell
Release author name: Jean Doe
Release author email: jean.doe@example.com
```

And finally we select a directory to create app in and skip advanced configuration:

```shell
Directory to write the app to: .
? Do you want to do any advanced configuration?:
  â–¸ no
    yes
```

The release author name, author email and directory are self-explanatory:

```plaintext
Release author name: Jean Doe
Release author email: jean.doe@example.com
Directory to write the app to: .
```

Finally, you can choose to do advanced configuration; in this basic introduction, we won't be doing that:

```plaintext
? Do you want to do any advanced configuration?:
  â–¸ no
    yes
```

After pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>, the project will be generated, dependencies will be installed and the instructions for continuing will be displayed:

```shell
2024/04/22 22:43:39 Fetching full license text from SPDX ...
2024/04/22 22:43:39 Success!
Succesfully generated application. To start it, run the following:

cd myapp
go run .

You can find more information in the generated README.
```

**Congratulations!** You've created your first hydrapp app. Next, let's start it!

### 2. Starting the New Project

Now that we've created the app, we can start it. To do so, simply follow the instructions that were printed in the last command, which should look something like this:

```shell
cd myapp
go run .
```

After starting the app, you should see the generated app open like so:

![Screenshot of the app once first launched](./docs/screenshot-first-launch.png)

**Cheers!** You've started your first hydrapp app. Next, let's find out how we can iterate efficiently on it!

ðŸš§ This project is a work-in-progress! Instructions will be added as soon as it is usable. ðŸš§
